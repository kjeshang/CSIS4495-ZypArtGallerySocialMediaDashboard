# ZypArtGallerySocialMediaDashboard

## Description

This project takes the form of a free and easy-to-use dashboard that is accessible from a web browser, and does not require installation of any additional software or dependencies whatsoever. It was developed to assist Zyp Art Gallery to derive social media insights from its Facebook & Instagram accounts. The dashboard application was developed using the Python programming language along with the Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, Dash, Gunicorn, and Flask libraries. The dashboard application itself was deployed to Heroku Free Tier with the help of Git and Heroku Command Line Tools.

The data source of the application is a collection of CSV files, containing the post, page, and demographic metric data. The data visualized in the application was programmatically extracted from Facebook Graph API, cleaned & transformed, and then loaded as CSV files also using Python. To view the data extraction scripts, please refer to the [Zyp Art Gallery Social Media Data Extraction](https://github.com/kjeshang/ZypArtGallery-SocialMediaDataExtraction) repository.

This project was developed within a four-month period from May 2022 to August 2022. The core audience was the Zyp Art Gallery organization; in particular, the analytics and marketing teams, as well as the Executive Director. This project was also used to fulfill the course requirements for CSIS 4495: Applied Research Project.

> Note that the CSV files used as the data source of the application are not provided here to ensure data privacy and protection of the Zyp Art Gallery organization and its social media followers. Therefore, this repository was created for the viewing the codebase of the dashboard application.
